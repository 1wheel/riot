This project includes the following:
  - Threadsafe, rate-limited API client. See `examples/example_apiclient`
  - Centralized rate-limiting service. See https://github.com/yuhanfang/riot/wiki/Rate-Limit-Service
  - Cached client with a Google Cloud backend. See `examples/example_cachedclient`
  - Static data client backed by data dragons. See `examples/example_staticdata`

In development are the following:
  - Champion select solver. Given a utility function for evaluating a team
    composition, solve for optimal pick/ban either as of the beginning of the
    game, or as of any node given any current state. See
    `analytics/champion_select/solver`

If any of this is interesting and you want to help out, I'm always happy to
